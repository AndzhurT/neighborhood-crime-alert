# neighborhood-crime-alert

### Project Description:
The Neighborhood Crime Alert Network (NCAN) uses graph-based algorithms to model a network of neighborhoods (nodes) connected by roads or proximity (edges). If a crime is reported at a node, nearby nodes within a certain distance receive a notification. The graph also provides a visual representation of alerts, helping law enforcement or community members take action.
